## Overview

**High Thread.js** is an abstraction for Node.js api `woker_threads`, focused on agility and performance during the development of highly complex algorithms or that need parallelism. 

## Motivation

**High Thread.js** was motivated to be created due to a deficit of data manipulation and parallel computing in `Node.js`, then encouraged to abstract practical and agile functions and methods to define a robust api that makes sense in the daily use of applications that demand such a need; 

## Roadmap

- Faster;
- In tests (IMPORTANT);
- Proper Documentation;
- no additional modules;
- Friendly API;

## Installation

**High Thread.js** is available at npm and you can purchase them through the following commands:

npm:

```
$ npm i xxxxx
```

or yarn:

```
$ yarn add xxxxx
```

## Guides

### Basics Thread Spawn

This bellow is code for a simple thread spawn:

```js
const { threadSpawn } = require("xxxxx");

const arr = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4];

const result = await threadSpawn(() => (
  arr.map((item, index) => Math.pow(item, index))
), [arr])

// prints result
console.log(result);
```
